# Ski_jumping_data_center
Hello. As a big ski jumping fan, I would like to invite everybody to something like a project called "Ski Jumping Data Center". Primary goal is as below:

"Collect as many data about ski-jumping as possible and create as many useful insights based on them as possible"

Exactly one month ago (18.09.20) I thought "Hmm, I don't know any statistical analyses of ski jumping". In fact, the only easily found public data analysis about SJ I know is

Question is: why? This discipline is in fact overloaded with data, but almost nobody took this topic seriously. Therefore I decided to start collecting data and analyzing them. However, the amount of work needed to capture various data (i.e. jumps and results of competitions) was so big and there is so many ways to use these informations, that make it public was obvious. In fact, I have a plan to expand my database to be as big as possible, but it requires more time and (I wish) more help.

In a few weeks I should summarize my work from the previous 30 days and draft a plan to next few weeks/months. Moreover, I want to describe data uploaded today, when free time will allow.
